MirrorWorld is an iOS app that transforms a user‚Äôs photo into a photorealistic animated 3D version of themselves, placed inside a fixed, cinematic-quality Unity park scene. Unlike filters or avatars, this experience captures and preserves emotional realism‚Äîeye glints, body shifts, subtle micro-motions.

It‚Äôs not a stylized cartoon‚Äîit‚Äôs you, but in 3D, breathing, blinking, alive in a virtual memory.

üß† System Overview: How It All Works

The app is made of two brain-halves:

üß© 1. SwiftUI (Frontend Brain) ‚Ä¢ Handles onboarding, permissions, camera/photo upload. ‚Ä¢ Smooth transitions, privacy first, no lag, no confusion. ‚Ä¢ Sends the uploaded photo securely to the backend for AI transformation. ‚Ä¢ After generation, launches the Unity park scene embedded inside the app, where the user sees their animated 3D self.

‚öôÔ∏è 2. AI + Unity Engine (Backend Brain) ‚Ä¢ Processes the photo into a full 3D model using a custom RenderNet + PIKE-inspired AI pipeline. ‚Ä¢ Adds natural facial expressions, body breathing, eye motion. ‚Ä¢ Unity loads the lifelike 3D version into a high-end rendered park, using dynamic lighting, sound, and atmosphere.

üõ†Ô∏è Step-by-Step Breakdown

‚∏ª

1Ô∏è‚É£ USER FLOW ‚Äî SwiftUI App

Actions: ‚Ä¢ User opens the app ‚Üí onboarding begins ‚Ä¢ SwiftUI walks them through steps: ‚Ä¢ Welcome + explanation ‚Ä¢ Camera/photo access permission ‚Ä¢ Upload or capture photo

Tech Stack: ‚Ä¢ SwiftUI, PhotoKit, AVFoundation, LocalAuthentication (optional Face ID lock) ‚Ä¢ Combine for reactive state ‚Ä¢ URLSession for backend API communication

Codex Jobs: ‚Ä¢ Write all SwiftUI components ‚Ä¢ Handle image selection/upload ‚Ä¢ Trigger backend upload + loading animation

2Ô∏è‚É£ AI PIPELINE ‚Äî Photo ‚Üí 3D

Transformation Flow: 1. Segmentation: Person is extracted from background using MODNet or SAM. 2. Depth Estimation: Facial and body structure is estimated using MiDaS or ZoeDepth. 3. Mesh Generation: RenderNet + PIKE-style model reconstructs high-fidelity geometry and texture. 4. Motion Injection: Adds facial blendshapes, idle breathing, blinking, and slight movements. 5. Rigging & Export: Converts it into a GLB or FBX file with baked animation.

Backend Infra: ‚Ä¢ FastAPI running in Docker ‚Ä¢ Hosted on GCP Cloud Run (or RunPod for GPU cost optimization) ‚Ä¢ Storage via Firebase Storage, AWS S3, or GCP Cloud Storage ‚Ä¢ Optional: Redis queue for task status and speed

Codex Jobs: ‚Ä¢ Write FastAPI endpoints to receive image, process it, and serve 3D model ‚Ä¢ Set up Docker container with required ML models ‚Ä¢ Write mesh-to-FBX/GLB conversion script ‚Ä¢ Handle cloud infra with startup-eligible configs

3Ô∏è‚É£ RENDERING ‚Äî Unity 3D Park Scene

Scene Design: ‚Ä¢ One cinematic park scene (trees, wind, birds, sunlight, ambient sound) ‚Ä¢ Your 3D self is placed on a bench or standing near a pond ‚Ä¢ Unity camera glides slowly, or user can rotate view

Tech Stack: ‚Ä¢ Unity HDRP for ultra-real lighting ‚Ä¢ Model loaded dynamically using UnityWebRequest or AssetBundles ‚Ä¢ Unity embedded as a library inside iOS

Character Features: ‚Ä¢ Skin shaders with SSS (Subsurface Scattering) ‚Ä¢ Eye reflections, blink animations ‚Ä¢ Slight chest movement (breathing) ‚Ä¢ Idle pose looped from neural estimation

Codex Jobs: ‚Ä¢ Write Unity C# loader to fetch and render user model ‚Ä¢ Build camera path script ‚Ä¢ Add particle systems for wind, leaves, etc. ‚Ä¢ Write interface for Unity ‚Üî SwiftUI communication

‚∏ª

üîê Privacy and Safety ‚Ä¢ All images encrypted in transit via HTTPS ‚Ä¢ Option to delete all user data immediately ‚Ä¢ Local face ID protection for viewing scene ‚Ä¢ GDPR-style consent for processing

‚∏ª

üöÄ Scalable Deployment Strategy

Cloud Services: ‚Ä¢ Compute: GCP Cloud Run or RunPod GPU ‚Ä¢ Model Hosting: Hugging Face Transformers or custom Docker registry ‚Ä¢ Storage: Firebase, S3, or GCP Storage ‚Ä¢ Database: Firestore or Supabase (optional)

Dev Tools: ‚Ä¢ Codex GPT-4 generates all code logic ‚Ä¢ GitHub + CI/CD pipeline to deploy iOS and backend ‚Ä¢ Firebase Crashlytics and Sentry for error tracking

üß™ Optional Future Modules ‚Ä¢ Add voice recording ‚Üí sync lip movement (NVIDIA Audio2Face) ‚Ä¢ Export Unity video as a keepsake ‚Ä¢ In-app purchase to add multiple scenes or emotions ‚Ä¢ Multi-person support (e.g., add a lost loved one from a second photo)
